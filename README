One-run script for symfony 1.x + sfPropelORMPlugin project generation!

Instructions:

- Download this package
- make a copy of bash/data.txt.dist named data.txt
- modify data.txt to fit your needs

then cd to the bash/ folder, and run the script with:

./sf_git_project.sh

This will perform these tasks (at a glance):
* create a project folder
* init a git repo for the new project
* create a lib/vendor folder
* download symfony from github
* generate a project and a frontend app
* download, configure and enable sfPropelORMPlugin from github (no need to follow the plugin's README) including their submodules (phing and propel)
* download and enable mpProjectPlugin (https://github.com/mppfiles/mpProjectPlugin.git)
* perform a lot of little tweaks to the project (most of them from symfony-check.org)
* plugin:publish-assets

But there's more!

If you feel really lazy, and want a fully automated installation instead of the default one, just adjust the variables on your data.txt file, and run:

./sf_git_project.sh -ad

This will perform these extra steps:

(from -d switch):
* ask you (or read from data.txt) the database connection settings
* propel:build-schema and propel:build --all-classes

(from -a switch):
* generate a sample apache configuration file (included in mpProjectPlugin)
* symlink this file to /etc/apache2/conf.d
* restart apache, and you can browse http://localhost/your_project right away

start with NOTHING, end with a FULLY configured AND RUNNING project!
